Composer
========

We recommend using [Composer]() to manage all third party PHP code dependencies, include contributed Drupal modules and themes.

Installing a new Module/Theme/Library
-------------------------------------
Use `composer require` to install new packages. Example:

```bash
composer require drupal/ctools
```
