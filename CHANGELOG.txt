Unreleased
----------
* Add a default hash salt to settings.docker.php, overrideable using the HASH_SALT environment variable.
* Remove default setting for SIMPLETEST_DB - let it fall back to whatever connection is defined in settings.php.
* Remove dockerized settings in default.settings.php - this file will be used whenever KernelTestBase is executed, causing the site under test to pick up the Dockerized/local settings as it's own.
* Recommend code linting be run locally via `composer lint` script instead of `gulp check`.
* Add phpcs.xml.dist to the repository root so we have the ability to configure rules on a per-site basis.
* Add .eslintignore to the repository root so we have more granularity on what files get linted.
* Recommend testing be run locally via `composer test` instead of `gulp test`.
