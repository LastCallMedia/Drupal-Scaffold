Upstream File Manifests
=======================

These manifest files are for use with the [Composer Upstream Files](https://github.com/LastCallMedia/Composer-Upstream-Files) command.  They define the files that should be updated when you run `composer upstream-files:update`.

* `all.json`: Include this to get the entire scaffold package.
* `drops.json`: This includes Pantheon's `settings.pantheon.php` from the Drops-8 repo.
* `drupal.json`: This includes Drupal's quasi-core files, like `index.php`, `update.php`, etc.
